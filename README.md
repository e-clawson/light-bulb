Objective: Make a switch that turns the light bulb off and the room dark (when clicked)

HINTS: 
- the "dark" class can be added to animate the divs with class of "switch" and "switch-button" 
- the light bulbs (off and on) are available in the assets folder inside src
- the background and color properties will need to change in response to clicking the switch

EXTRA:
- add a sound effect when the light switch is clicked (an audio file is provided in the assets folder)
- add a brightness control feature using an input with type of "range" (look up the filter CSS property and its brightness function)

Things that helped me: 

- this stack overflow helped me figure out how to chnge the lights - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329641/react-toggling-between-two-images-on-click-in-stateless-component 
- Iryna helped me figure out how to get the sound to work by explaining what she did and sharing this image: ![alt text](/Users/elizabethclawson/Downloads/light-bulb/src/assets/Screen Shot 2024-09-24 at 2.58.17 PM.png)
